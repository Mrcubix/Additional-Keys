# Additional Keys

This OTD plugin will allow you to use media, as well as additional F keys on your tablet.

Note: MacOS only seem to support up to F20 compared to linux and windows which both support up to F24

## How to install

If someone bothered to add this to the plugin repo (i can't cause i'm banned), then you should 
be able to download it via the plugin manager.

If not, then you can download the 0.6.0.3+ compatible .zip file from the [Release](https://github.com/Mrcubix/Additional-Keys/releases/latest) 
page. This file contains the metadata and the dll for the plugin.
You can then open the plugin manager, go to File > Install plugin... > select the downloaded .zip file .
And with that done, it should be ready and working!

## How to use

1. Open the advanced binding editor (the ... button next to binds),
2. For the type, select either Media keys of F keys,
